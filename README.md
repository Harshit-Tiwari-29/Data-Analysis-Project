## 1. Introduction
Agriculture is a cornerstone of global sustenance, and precision agriculture helps optimize resource usage and crop yield. This project focuses on analyzing environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil pH to provide data-driven crop recommendations. Leveraging machine learning, the project aims to build a model that helps farmers make informed decisions about crop selection.

## 2. Methodology
#### a.	Data Preparation:
* The dataset was loaded from Crop_recommendation.csv.
* Key attributes such as temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall were analyzed for various crop types.
* Descriptive statistics (minimum, maximum, mean) were computed for each crop.
#### b.	Data Preprocessing:
* The dataset was normalized and standardized to ensure consistent scaling of features.
* Relationships between variables such as soil pH and nitrogen were explored.
#### c.	Visualization:
* Hexbin plots were created to visualize the density distribution of crops concerning soil pH and rainfall.
* Additional scatter plots were used to understand correlations among variables like pH and temperature.
#### d. Model Development:
* A classification model was developed using machine learning techniques (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors and K-Means clustering).
* Features such as soil pH, temperature, and rainfall served as inputs for crop recommendation.

## 3. Results and Discussion
#### a. Statistical Analysis:
* Identified minimum, maximum, and mean values of temperature, humidity, and rainfall for each crop type.
* These insights help establish favorable conditions for specific crops.
#### b. Visualization Insights:
* The hexbin plots revealed regions of higher density, showcasing optimal environmental conditions for particular crops.
* Correlation analysis showed the dependency of crops on key factors like soil pH and nitrogen content.
#### c. Model Performance:
* The classification model successfully recommended crops based on input parameters.
* Accuracy metrics demonstrated the robustness of the machine learning model.

## 4. Conclusion
This project illustrates the potential of data-driven approaches in agriculture. By analyzing environmental factors and employing machine learning, farmers can receive accurate recommendations tailored to their fields. Future work could involve integrating real-time data and expanding the model to include additional factors such as pest resistance or market trends.
