Impact of Soil Quality on Crop Growth Analysis and Model Building

Overview

Agriculture is a cornerstone of global sustenance, and precision agriculture helps optimize resource usage and crop yield. This project focuses on analyzing environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil pH to provide data-driven crop recommendations. Leveraging machine learning, the project aims to build a model that helps farmers make informed decisions about crop selection.
